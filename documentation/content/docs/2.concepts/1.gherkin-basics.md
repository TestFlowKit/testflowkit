# Gherkin Basics

Gherkin is a plain-text language that uses a simple structure to describe software behavior. TestFlowKit uses Gherkin to make tests readable by everyone on your team.

## What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented.

## File Structure

Gherkin files use the `.feature` extension and follow a specific structure:

```gherkin
Feature: Feature Name
  Feature description goes here.
  It can span multiple lines.

  Background:
    Given common setup steps

  Scenario: First scenario
    Given some precondition
    When some action
    Then expected result

  Scenario: Second scenario
    Given another precondition
    When another action
    Then another result
```

## Keywords

### Feature

Every `.feature` file starts with a `Feature` keyword followed by a name and optional description:

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart
  As a customer
  I want to manage items in my cart
  So that I can purchase products
```

### Scenario

A `Scenario` is a concrete example that illustrates a business rule:

```gherkin
Scenario: Add item to empty cart
  Given the cart is empty
  When I add a product to the cart
  Then the cart should contain 1 item
```

### Background

`Background` allows you to add context to all scenarios in a feature file. It runs before each scenario:

```gherkin
Feature: Account Management

  Background:
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user goes to the "settings" page

  Scenario: Change email
    When the user enters "new@email.com" into the "email" field
    ...

  Scenario: Change password
    When the user enters "newpassword" into the "password" field
    ...
```

### Steps

Steps are the building blocks of scenarios. Each step starts with a keyword:

| Keyword | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Given** | Setup/Precondition | `Given the user is logged in` |
| **When** | Action/Event | `When the user clicks "submit"` |
| **Then** | Expected outcome | `Then the "success" message should be visible` |
| **And** | Additional step | `And the cart total is "$50"` |
| **But** | Negative assertion | `But the "error" should not be visible` |

> ℹ️ **Step Keywords are Interchangeable:** Gherkin treats Given, When, Then, And, and But as interchangeable. The distinction is for human readability only. TestFlowKit matches steps by their text pattern, not the keyword.

## Data Tables

Use data tables to pass structured data to steps:

```gherkin
Scenario: Fill registration form
  Given the user goes to the "register" page
  When the user fills the form with:
    | field    | value           |
    | name     | John Doe        |
    | email    | john@example.com|
    | password | secret123       |
  And the user clicks the "submit" button
```

## Doc Strings

For multi-line text, use doc strings (triple quotes):

```gherkin
Scenario: Submit feedback
  Given the user goes to the "feedback" page
  When the user enters the following into the "message" field:
    """
    This is a multi-line message.
    It can contain special characters: @#$%
    And preserves formatting.
    """
```

## Tags

Tags allow you to organize and filter scenarios:

```gherkin
@smoke @critical
Feature: Authentication

  @login
  Scenario: Valid login
    ...

  @login @negative
  Scenario: Invalid password
    ...

  @registration
  Scenario: New user signup
    ...
```

Run specific tagged tests:

```bash
# Run smoke tests
tkit run --tags @smoke

# Run login tests excluding negative cases
tkit run --tags "@login and not @negative"
```

## Scenario Outline

Use `Scenario Outline` with `Examples` to run the same scenario with different data:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Login with different credentials
  Given the user goes to the "login" page
  When the user enters "<email>" into the "email" field
  And the user enters "<password>" into the "password" field
  And the user clicks the "login" button
  Then the "<result>" should be visible

  Examples:
    | email              | password  | result        |
    | valid@example.com  | correct   | dashboard     |
    | invalid@example.com| wrong     | error_message |
    | empty              | empty     | error_message |
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Declarative Steps

Focus on *what* the user wants to achieve, not *how* they do it:

**Declarative (Good):**
```gherkin
Given the user is logged in as admin
```

**Imperative (Avoid):**
```gherkin
Given the user goes to the "login" page
And the user enters "admin@example.com" into the "email" field
And the user enters "adminpass" into the "password" field
And the user clicks the "login" button
```

Use macros to encapsulate imperative steps into declarative ones.

### 2. Keep Scenarios Independent

Each scenario should be self-contained and not depend on other scenarios.

### 3. Use Meaningful Names

Scenario names should clearly describe what is being tested:

```gherkin
# Good
Scenario: User receives validation error when submitting empty form

# Bad  
Scenario: Test form validation
```
