# Step Definitions

This page provides an overview of available step definitions in TestFlowKit. For a complete, searchable dictionary of all steps, visit the [Step Definitions Browser](/sentences).

## Categories

TestFlowKit provides step definitions organized by category:

### Navigation Steps

Steps for navigating between pages and URLs.

```gherkin
Given the user goes to the "page_name" page
Given the user navigates to "https://example.com"
When the user refreshes the page
When the user goes back
When the user goes forward
```

### Form Interaction Steps

Steps for interacting with form elements.

```gherkin
When the user enters "text" into the "field_name" field
When the user clears the "field_name" field
When the user selects "option" from the "dropdown_name" dropdown
When the user checks the "checkbox_name" checkbox
When the user unchecks the "checkbox_name" checkbox
```

### Click Steps

Steps for clicking elements.

```gherkin
When the user clicks the "element_name" button
When the user clicks the "element_name" link
When the user clicks the "element_name" element
When the user double-clicks the "element_name" element
When the user right-clicks the "element_name" element
```

### Mouse Steps

Steps for mouse interactions.

```gherkin
When the user hovers over the "element_name" element
When the user drags the "source" element to the "target" element
When the user scrolls to the "element_name" element
```

### Keyboard Steps

Steps for keyboard interactions.

```gherkin
When the user presses the "Enter" key
When the user presses "Control+A"
When the user types "text to type"
```

### Assertion Steps

Steps for verifying page state.

```gherkin
Then the "element_name" should be visible
Then the "element_name" should not be visible
Then the "element_name" should contain "text"
Then the "element_name" should not contain "text"
Then the page title should be "Title"
Then the page title should contain "Partial Title"
Then the current URL should be "https://example.com"
Then the current URL should contain "/path"
Then the "element_name" should be enabled
Then the "element_name" should be disabled
Then there should be 5 "element_name" elements
```

### Wait Steps

Steps for waiting.

```gherkin
When the user waits for 2 seconds
When the user waits for the "element_name" to be visible
When the user waits for the "element_name" to disappear
```

### Variable Steps

Steps for working with variables.

```gherkin
When I store the "value" into "variable_name" variable
When I store the content of "element_name" into "variable_name" variable
When I store the JSON path "$.data.id" from the response into "variable_name" variable
When I save the response path "$.token" as global variable "token_name"
When I store the value "value" into global variable "variable_name"
```

### REST API Steps

Steps for REST API testing.

```gherkin
Given I prepare a request for the "endpoint_name" endpoint
And I set the request body to:
  """
  {"key": "value"}
  """
And I set the following path parameters:
  | param | value |
And I set the following query parameters:
  | param | value |
And I set the request header "Header-Name" to "value"
When I send the request
Then the response status code should be 200
Then the response should contain "text"
Then the response JSON path "$.data.id" should be "123"
Then the response JSON path "$.data.field" should exist
Then the response time should be less than 1000 milliseconds
```

### GraphQL Steps

Steps for GraphQL API testing.

```gherkin
Given I prepare a GraphQL request for the "query_name" query
And I set the GraphQL variables to:
  """
  {"id": "123"}
  """
When I send the GraphQL request
Then the response JSON path "data.user.name" should be "John"
```

### Visual Steps

Steps for visual testing.

```gherkin
When I take a screenshot
When I take a screenshot named "page_state"
When I capture a visual snapshot of "component_name"
Then the "component_name" should match the visual baseline
```

## Step Definition Browser

For the complete, searchable list of all step definitions with examples and parameters, use the interactive [Step Definitions Browser](/sentences).

The browser allows you to:
- Search by keyword
- Filter by category
- View parameter types
- Copy step syntax

## Custom Step Patterns

### String Parameters

Enclosed in quotes, replaced with actual values:

```gherkin
When the user enters "john@example.com" into the "email" field
#                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^         ^^^^^^^
#                   string parameter           string parameter
```

### Table Parameters

Structured data passed to steps:

```gherkin
And I set the following path parameters:
  | userId    | 123 |
  | commentId | 456 |
```

### Doc String Parameters

Multi-line text content:

```gherkin
And I set the request body to:
  """
  {
    "name": "John",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  """
```
