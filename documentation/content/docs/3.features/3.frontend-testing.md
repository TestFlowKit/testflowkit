# Frontend Testing

TestFlowKit provides powerful browser automation capabilities for testing web applications. This guide covers all frontend testing features.

## Browser Drivers

TestFlowKit supports two browser automation drivers:

### Rod Driver

The default driver using [go-rod](https://go-rod.github.io/), providing fast and reliable Chrome/Chromium automation.

**When to use:**
- Default choice for most testing scenarios
- Fast execution with minimal overhead
- Stable and well-tested
- Lower resource consumption

### Playwright Driver

Alternative driver using [playwright-go](https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go), offering advanced browser automation features.

**When to use:**
- Need advanced browser features
- Cross-browser testing requirements
- Complex web application scenarios
- Modern web platform capabilities

**Prerequisites:**

To use the Playwright driver, run the install command:

```bash
tkit install --config=config.yml
```

This automatically installs Chromium and system dependencies.

::alert{type="warning"}
**Requirements:** The Playwright driver requires [Go 1.19+](https://golang.org/dl/) and an internet connection for installation.
::

### Configuration

Specify the driver in your `config.yml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  driver: "rod"  # or "playwright"
  default_timeout: 10000
  headless: false
  screenshot_on_failure: true
```

::alert{type="warning"}
The `driver` field is **required** when the frontend block is defined in your configuration.

## Browser Support

TestFlowKit currently supports Chromium for browser automation. Support for Firefox and WebKit will be added in future releases.

| Browser | Engine | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Chromium | Chrome/Edge | ✅ Available |
| Firefox | Gecko | 🔜 Coming soon |
| WebKit | Safari | 🔜 Coming soon |

## Navigation

### Going to Pages

Use named pages defined in your configuration:

```gherkin
# Using named page
Given the user goes to the "login" page

# Using direct URL
Given the user navigates to "https://example.com/custom-path"
```

### Page Verification

```gherkin
# Verify URL
Then the current URL should be "https://example.com/dashboard"
Then the current URL should contain "/dashboard"

# Verify page title
Then the page title should be "Dashboard"
Then the page title should contain "Dashboard"
```

## Element Interactions

### Clicking Elements

```gherkin
# Click a button
When the user clicks the "submit" button

# Click a link
When the user clicks the "about_us" link

# Click any element
When the user clicks the "modal_overlay" element
```

### Form Inputs

```gherkin
# Text input
When the user enters "john@example.com" into the "email" field

# Clear and enter
When the user clears the "search" field
When the user enters "new search" into the "search" field

# Textarea
When the user enters "Long message here" into the "message" field
```

### Select Dropdowns

```gherkin
# Select by visible text
When the user selects "United States" from the "country" dropdown

# Select by value
When the user selects option with value "US" from the "country" dropdown
```

### Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

```gherkin
# Check a checkbox
When the user checks the "terms" checkbox

# Uncheck a checkbox
When the user unchecks the "newsletter" checkbox

# Select radio button
When the user selects the "express_shipping" radio button
```

## Assertions

### Visibility

```gherkin
# Element should be visible
Then the "success_message" should be visible
Then the "welcome_banner" should be visible

# Element should not be visible
Then the "error_message" should not be visible
Then the "loading_spinner" should not be visible
```

### Text Content

```gherkin
# Exact content
Then the "heading" should contain "Welcome"

# Partial match
Then the "paragraph" should contain "some text"

# Should not contain
Then the "error_container" should not contain "failed"
```

### Element State

```gherkin
# Enabled/Disabled
Then the "submit_button" should be enabled
Then the "next_button" should be disabled

# Form field value
Then the "email" field should contain "john@example.com"
Then the "email" field should be empty
```

### Element Count

```gherkin
# Count elements
Then there should be 5 "product_card" elements
Then there should be at least 1 "result_item" element
```

## Mouse Actions

### Hover

```gherkin
When the user hovers over the "user_menu" element
Then the "dropdown" should be visible
```

### Double Click

```gherkin
When the user double-clicks the "editable_text" element
Then the "edit_input" should be visible
```

### Right Click

```gherkin
When the user right-clicks the "file_item" element
Then the "context_menu" should be visible
```

### Drag and Drop

```gherkin
When the user drags the "item_1" element to the "drop_zone" element
```

## Keyboard Actions

### Key Press

```gherkin
# Press Enter
When the user presses the "Enter" key

# Press Escape
When the user presses the "Escape" key

# Keyboard shortcuts
When the user presses "Control+S"
When the user presses "Command+A"
```

### Type Text

```gherkin
# Type into focused element
When the user types "search query"
```

## Scrolling

```gherkin
# Scroll element into view
When the user scrolls to the "footer" element

# Scroll page
When the user scrolls down
When the user scrolls up
When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page
When the user scrolls to the top of the page
```

## Waiting

### Explicit Waits

```gherkin
# Wait for time
When the user waits for 2 seconds

# Wait for element
When the user waits for the "results" to be visible
When the user waits for the "loading" to disappear
```

### Implicit Waits

TestFlowKit automatically waits for elements before interacting. Configure timeout:

```yaml
frontend:
  default_timeout: 1000  # 1 second (in milliseconds)
```

## Screenshots

### On Failure

Automatically capture screenshots when tests fail:

```yaml
frontend:
  screenshot_on_failure: true
```

### Manual Screenshots

```gherkin
When I take a screenshot
When I take a screenshot named "checkout_page"
```

## Iframes

```gherkin
# Switch to iframe
When the user switches to the "payment_iframe" iframe

# Perform actions inside iframe
When the user enters "4111111111111111" into the "card_number" field

# Switch back to main content
When the user switches to the main content
```

## Alerts and Dialogs

```gherkin
# Accept alert
When the user accepts the alert

# Dismiss alert
When the user dismisses the alert

# Enter text in prompt
When the user enters "confirmation text" in the prompt
When the user accepts the alert
```

## Multiple Windows/Tabs

```gherkin
# Switch to new window
When a new window opens
And the user switches to the new window

# Switch back
When the user switches to the original window

# Close current window
When the user closes the current window
```

## Visual Testing

```gherkin
# Capture baseline
When I capture a visual snapshot of "homepage"

# Compare with baseline
Then the "homepage" should match the visual baseline
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Element Names

```yaml
# Good
elements:
  submit_registration_form: "#register-submit"
  
# Bad
elements:
  btn1: "#register-submit"
```

### 2. Wait Appropriately

```gherkin
# Good: Wait for specific element
When the user clicks the "load_more" button
And the user waits for the "new_items" to be visible

# Bad: Arbitrary sleep
When the user clicks the "load_more" button
And the user waits for 5 seconds
```

### 3. Verify State After Actions

```gherkin
# Always verify the action had the expected effect
When the user clicks the "submit" button
Then the "success_message" should be visible
And the current URL should contain "/confirmation"
```
