# API Testing

TestFlowKit provides comprehensive backend testing capabilities for REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints.

## REST API Testing

### Configuration

Configure your API endpoints in `config.yml`:

```yaml
backend:
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com"
  timeout: 10000
  
  headers:
    Content-Type: "application/json"
    Accept: "application/json"
  
  endpoints:
    get_users:
      method: GET
      path: "/users"
    
    get_user:
      method: GET
      path: "/users/{id}"
    
    create_user:
      method: POST
      path: "/users"
    
    update_user:
      method: PUT
      path: "/users/{id}"
    
    delete_user:
      method: DELETE
      path: "/users/{id}"
```

### Basic Requests

#### GET Request

```gherkin
Scenario: Fetch user list
  Given I prepare a request for the "get_users" endpoint
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response should contain "users"
```

#### POST Request

```gherkin
Scenario: Create new user
  Given I prepare a request for the "create_user" endpoint
  And I set the request body to:
    """
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    """
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 201
  And the response JSON path "data.name" should be "John Doe"
```

#### PUT Request

```gherkin
Scenario: Update user
  Given I prepare a request for the "update_user" endpoint
  And I set the following path parameters:
    | id | 123 |
  And I set the request body to:
    """
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe"
    }
    """
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200
```

#### DELETE Request

```gherkin
Scenario: Delete user
  Given I prepare a request for the "delete_user" endpoint
  And I set the following path parameters:
    | id | 123 |
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 204
```

### Path Parameters

```gherkin
# Single parameter
Given I prepare a request for the "get_user" endpoint
And I set the following path parameters:
  | id | 456 |
When I send the request

# Multiple parameters
Given I prepare a request for the "get_comment" endpoint
And I set the following path parameters:
  | postId    | 123 |
  | commentId | 789 |
When I send the request
```

### Query Parameters

```gherkin
Given I prepare a request for the "get_users" endpoint
And I set the following query parameters:
  | page     | 1     |
  | limit    | 10    |
  | status   | active |
  | sort     | name   |
When I send the request
```

### Request Headers

```gherkin
# Set individual header
Given I prepare a request for the "protected_endpoint" endpoint
And I set the request header "Authorization" to "Bearer {{auth_token}}"
When I send the request

# Set multiple headers
Given I prepare a request for the "api_endpoint" endpoint
And I set the following request headers:
  | Authorization | Bearer {{token}} |
  | X-API-Key     | my-api-key       |
  | Accept-Language | en-US          |
When I send the request
```

### Request Body

#### JSON Body

```gherkin
Given I prepare a request for the "create_product" endpoint
And I set the request body to:
  """
  {
    "name": "Product Name",
    "price": 99.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "inStock": true,
    "tags": ["new", "featured"]
  }
  """
When I send the request
```

#### Form Data

```gherkin
Given I prepare a request for the "submit_form" endpoint
And I set the form data to:
  | name  | John Doe     |
  | email | john@example.com |
  | file  | @/path/to/file.pdf |
When I send the request
```

## Response Assertions

### Status Code

```gherkin
Then the response status code should be 200
Then the response status code should be 201
Then the response status code should be 404
Then the response status code should be 500
```

### Response Body

```gherkin
# Contains text
Then the response should contain "success"

# JSON path assertions
Then the response JSON path "data.id" should be "123"
Then the response JSON path "data.name" should be "John Doe"
Then the response JSON path "data.active" should be "true"
Then the response JSON path "data.items.length" should be "5"

# JSON path existence
Then the response JSON path "data.email" should exist
Then the response JSON path "data.password" should not exist
```

### Response Headers

```gherkin
Then the response header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
Then the response header "X-Request-Id" should exist
```

### Response Time

```gherkin
Then the response time should be less than 1000 milliseconds
Then the response time should be less than 2 seconds
```

## Extracting Data

Store response data in variables for later use:

```gherkin
# Extract from JSON path
When I send the request
And I store the JSON path "data.id" from the response into "user_id" variable
And I store the JSON path "data.token" from the response into "auth_token" variable

# Use extracted data
Given I prepare a request for the "get_user" endpoint
And I set the following path parameters:
  | id | {{user_id}} |
And I set the request header "Authorization" to "Bearer {{auth_token}}"
```

## GraphQL Testing

### Configuration

```yaml
graphql:
  url: "https://api.example.com/graphql"
  
  headers:
    Content-Type: "application/json"
  
  queries:
    get_user: "graphql/queries/get_user.graphql"
    create_post: "graphql/mutations/create_post.graphql"
```

### Query Files

Create `.graphql` files for your operations:

```graphql
# graphql/queries/get_user.graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
# graphql/mutations/create_post.graphql
mutation CreatePost($input: CreatePostInput!) {
  createPost(input: $input) {
    id
    title
    content
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Executing Queries

```gherkin
Scenario: Fetch user data
  Given I prepare a GraphQL request for the "get_user" query
  And I set the GraphQL variables to:
    """
    {
      "id": "123"
    }
    """
  When I send the GraphQL request
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response JSON path "data.user.name" should be "John Doe"
```

### Executing Mutations

```gherkin
Scenario: Create a new post
  Given I prepare a GraphQL request for the "create_post" query
  And I set the GraphQL variables to:
    """
    {
      "input": {
        "title": "My New Post",
        "content": "This is the content"
      }
    }
    """
  When I send the GraphQL request
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response JSON path "data.createPost.id" should exist
  And I store the JSON path "data.createPost.id" from the response into "post_id" variable
```

## Authentication Patterns

### Bearer Token

```gherkin
Background:
  Given I prepare a request for the "login" endpoint
  And I set the request body to:
    """
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    """
  When I send the request
  And I store the JSON path "token" from the response into "auth_token" variable

Scenario: Access protected resource
  Given I prepare a request for the "protected_data" endpoint
  And I set the request header "Authorization" to "Bearer {{auth_token}}"
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200
```

### API Key

```gherkin
Scenario: Request with API key
  Given I prepare a request for the "external_api" endpoint
  And I set the request header "X-API-Key" to "{{api_key}}"
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Endpoint Names

```yaml
# Good
endpoints:
  create_user_account:
    method: POST
    path: "/users"

# Bad
endpoints:
  post1:
    method: POST
    path: "/users"
```

### 2. Validate Response Structure

```gherkin
# Verify all important fields
Then the response status code should be 200
And the response JSON path "data.id" should exist
And the response JSON path "data.name" should be "Expected Name"
And the response JSON path "data.email" should exist
```

### 3. Chain API Calls Appropriately

```gherkin
Scenario: Full CRUD workflow
  # Create
  Given I prepare a request for the "create_item" endpoint
  And I set the request body to:
    """
    {"name": "Test Item"}
    """
  When I send the request
  And I store the JSON path "data.id" from the response into "item_id" variable
  Then the response status code should be 201

  # Read
  Given I prepare a request for the "get_item" endpoint
  And I set the following path parameters:
    | id | {{item_id}} |
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200

  # Update
  Given I prepare a request for the "update_item" endpoint
  And I set the following path parameters:
    | id | {{item_id}} |
  And I set the request body to:
    """
    {"name": "Updated Item"}
    """
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 200

  # Delete
  Given I prepare a request for the "delete_item" endpoint
  And I set the following path parameters:
    | id | {{item_id}} |
  When I send the request
  Then the response status code should be 204
```
