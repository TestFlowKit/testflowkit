# Quick Start

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a test project and write your first automated test with TestFlowKit.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have TestFlowKit installed:

::code-group
```bash [npm (Recommended)]
npm install -g @testflowkit/cli
tkit --version
```

```bash [npx (No install)]
npx @testflowkit/cli --version
```

```bash [Direct Download]
# Download from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/TestFlowKit/testflowkit/releases
./tkit --version
```
::

## What We'll Build

We'll create a simple test that:
1. Visits a web page
2. Interacts with a search field
3. Verifies the search results

## Step 1: Create Project Structure

Create a new folder for your test project with the following structure:

```
my-test-project/
├── config.yml
└── features/
    └── search.feature
```

## Step 2: Create Configuration File

Create a `config.yml` file in your project folder:

```yaml
active_environment: "local"

settings:
  page_load_timeout: 30000
  think_time: 100
  concurrency: 1
  report_format: "html"
  gherkin_location: "features"

environments:
  local:
    frontend_base_url: "http://localhost:3000"

frontend:
  default_timeout: 1000
  headless: false
  screenshot_on_failure: true
  
  pages:
    sentences: "sentences"

  elements:
    common:
      search_field:
        - "#search-input"
```

### Configuration Breakdown

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `active_environment` | The environment to use from the environments section |
| `environments` | Environment configurations with frontend and API URLs |
| `settings.page_load_timeout` | Maximum wait time for page loads (ms) |
| `settings.think_time` | Delay between actions (ms) for debugging |
| `settings.report_format` | Output format for test reports |
| `settings.gherkin_location` | Folder containing feature files |
| `frontend.default_timeout` | Default timeout for element interactions (ms) |
| `frontend.headless` | Run without visible browser window |
| `frontend.screenshot_on_failure` | Capture screenshots when tests fail |
| `frontend.pages` | Named page paths |
| `frontend.elements` | Element selectors grouped by page with fallbacks |

## Step 3: Write Your First Test

Create a `search.feature` file in the `features` folder:

```gherkin
Feature: Search Functionality

  Scenario: User can search for sentence
    Given the user goes to the "sentences" page
    When the user enters "field" into the search field
    Then the user should see "the user enters {string} into the {string} field" on the page

```

### Understanding the Syntax

- **Feature**: Describes the feature being tested
- **Scenario**: A specific test case
- **Given**: Sets up the initial state
- **When**: Describes the action
- **And**: Adds additional actions or assertions
- **Then**: Describes the expected outcome

## Step 4: Run Your Test

Open a terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
tkit run
```

TestFlowKit will:
1. Read your configuration
2. Launch the browser
3. Execute your test steps
4. Generate a report

## Step 5: View the Report

Open the generated HTML report in your browser to see detailed test results, including:
- Pass/fail status for each step
- Execution time
- Screenshots (on failure)

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tkit run` | Run all tests |
| `tkit run --tags @smoke` | Run tests with specific tag |
| `tkit run --headless` | Run in headless mode |
| `tkit validate` | Validate configuration |
| `tkit init` | Initialize a new project |
